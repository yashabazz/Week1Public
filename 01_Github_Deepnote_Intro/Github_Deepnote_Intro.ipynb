One person in your group must share their notebook with the others so that they can edit it and work on the same code. To share the notebook with others, follow the below steps.\n\n#### 1. Click the Share button (has a globe next to it) at the top right of your screen in Deepnote. Under \"Public access\", set the drop-down field to \"Edit\".\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Medlytics2021/Week1Public/master/Images/share.PNG)\n\n#### 2.
